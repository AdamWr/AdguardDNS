### What is Adguard DNS?

Adguard DNS is an alternative way to block ads, trackers and phishing websites, and also a parental control instrument.

### How does Adguard DNS work?

If you configure your network to use our DNS servers, every time a website sends an ad or phishing request, our server sends back a null response. Adguard has a database of domain names that serve for ad, tracking or phishing purposes, and this database is regularly updated.


Adguard DNS works in two modes:
'Default' mode includes blocking ads, various trackers and malware & phishing websites. 
'Family protection' does the same, but also blocks websites with adult content.

### How to use Adguard DNS?

The detailed guide can be found on [our website](https://test.adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/instruction.html#instruction).

### What's next?

We plan to make Adguard DNS opensource in the near future.
